This is the first step I begining
I want to write some words
and then learn  how to pull 
how to commit
how to branch
how to change 
and mang other functions which I don't know yet

This is the second step I am doing now
I am editing the first text I just created rightnow
Then the first text and the second text will consistant a master branch
Is there right
Let's looK

This is the third step I am doing
In this step, I revised a misspelling in the second text
and I aslo saw the options "commit directly to the master branch" or "creat a new branch"
It is amazoning, each change we done can be found and saved
maybe I can use this to write my scientific manuscript
I am looking forward to this
It looks like that a new door has been opend for me
but I am not good at using it yet


i create a new branch with a different method a differt way
becasue in the previous step i commit the forth step in a new branch
but then i don't know how to see the network 
there must be something wrong with my operations
so i rewatched the TV course in B-website and try to do it again
Do will I sucess this time?
Try


This is the sixth step
according to the TV course , actually i review the course again
and I found the bottun "network"
and I also found the reason why i failed to get the "network" in the first time
Bescause there is a littet different between the website interface in the TV and the website interface i used now
In the github interface of the TV, the "network" is under the menu of "graph", but in the github interface i used now, the "network" buttom
is under the menu of "insight". 
So next time, I need to watch the TV course carefully, and doing practice while watching TV 

the second day 2019-4-1 
I want try again the "pull request" to pull my branch back to the master branch
now these context is edited in may branch 
then it will go back to may master branch


Just now I did the operation of "pull request"
now I come back to my master branch 
I found that if you do this operation step by step following that TV course
Things will become easy
