This is the first step I begining
I want to write some words
and then learn  how to pull 
how to commit
how to branch
how to change 
and mang other functions which I don't know yet

This is the second step I am doing now
I am editing the first text I just created rightnow
Then the first text and the second text will consistant a master branch
Is there right
Let's looK

This is the third step I am doing
In this step, I revised a misspelling in the second text
and I aslo saw the options "commit directly to the master branch" or "creat a new branch"
It is amazoning, each change we done can be found and saved
maybe I can use this to write my scientific manuscript
I am looking forward to this
It looks like that a new door has been opend for me
but I am not good at using it yet


i create a new branch with a different method a differt way
becasue in the previous step i commit the forth step in a new branch
but then i don't know how to see the network 
there must be something wrong with my operations
so i rewatched the TV course in B-website and try to do it again
Do will I sucess this time?
Try
